    "Both the _oxygen generator rating_ and the _CO2 scrubber rating_ are values that can be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky part. Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and consider just the first bit of those numbers. Then:\n",

    "- Start with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are more `1` bits (7) than `0` bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with a `1` in the first position: `11110`, `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, `11100`, `10000`, and `11001`.\n",
    "- Then, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more `0` bits (4) than `1` bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a `0` in the second position: `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, and `10000`.\n",
    "- In the third position, three of the four numbers have a `1`, so keep those three: `10110`, `10111`, and `10101`.\n",
    "- In the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a `1`, so keep those two: `10110` and `10111`.\n",
    "- In the fifth position, there are an equal number of `0` bits and `1` bits (one each). So, to find the oxygen generator rating, keep the number with a `1` in that position: `10111`.\n",

    "- Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer `1` bits (2) than `0` bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a `1` in the second position: `01111` and `01010`.\n",

    "\n",
    "You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible. They tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0,9 -> 5,9\n",
    "8,0 -> 0,8\n",
    "9,4 -> 3,4\n",
    "2,2 -> 2,1\n",
    "7,0 -> 7,4\n",
    "6,4 -> 2,0\n",
    "0,9 -> 2,9\n",
    "3,4 -> 1,4\n",
    "0,0 -> 8,8\n",
    "5,5 -> 8,2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format `x1,y1 -> x2,y2` where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "An entry like `1,1 -> 1,3` covers points `1,1`, `1,2`, and `1,3`.\n",
    "An entry like `9,7 -> 7,7` covers points `9,7`, `8,7`, and `7,7`.\n",
    "For now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either `x1 = x2` or `y1 = y2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".......1..\n",
    "..1....1..\n",
    "..1....1..\n",
    ".......1..\n",
    ".112111211\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..........\n",
    "222111....\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this diagram, the top left corner is `0,0` and the bottom right corner is `9,9`. Each position is shown as the number of lines which cover that point or `.` if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of `1`s, for example, comes from `2,2 -> 2,1`; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines `0,9 -> 5,9` and `0,9 -> 2,9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - a total of 5 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?"
